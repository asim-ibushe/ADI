Hello Everyone,
Android Application for a small scale industry, each product engineered by industry obtain its own weight.
It is a tedious task each time to calculate product1_total_Weight= (quantityof Product1) * (Weightof singleProduct1)
It is not feasible to remember weight of each product, also there are N no of product engineered by an Industry.
while in Transportation Management protocol is to limit total weight to a defined threshold value.
Hence,calculate product1_total_Weight+calculate product2_total_Weight+........+calculate productN_total_Weight = It will Return Gross weight of Load in Vehicle
if Gross weight of Transportation vehicle exceed defined threshold value->Notify using red color, you need to unload some of your engineered product from vehicle.
Yupp,thats it 
Thank You....
